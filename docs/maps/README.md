# Maps

Current version:

- `system` : `0.9.0`

## Styles

This project used `mapbox` as the maps provider.

The `styles` currently in use are:

- `Simple Style`: mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v10
- `Satellite Style`: mapbox://styles/filipecruz/cl4e4ijzh001d15payt0kahpm

The `Satellite Style` was altered to display an updated satellite view of project #001 and #002.

## Further Discussion

As always, changes/improvements to the maps/styles used are expected.
